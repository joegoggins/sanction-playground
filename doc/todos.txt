Notes to Matt and Pete:
* null on principal_id is legit eh, do you have a use case for that, something like:
    Magazine.authorize :editor, User
  is legit and creates a role row with both _id cols as null...does it mean:
    All Users have the editor role over all Magazines?  if so, there is a bug:
		>> u
		=> #<User id: "00633107804", name: "joe", created_at: "2010-01-26 23:11:58", updated_at: "2010-01-26 23:11:58">
		>> u.has? :editor
		=> false
		
	Is there a different way to make sense of this?
