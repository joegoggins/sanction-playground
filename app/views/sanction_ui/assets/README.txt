Files placed here with the same relative path as stuff in vendor/plugins/sanction_ui/ will be
used instead of the files in the plugin.


You can override specific .html.erb views by simply copying from vendor/plugins/sanction_ui/app/views/sanction_ui into app/views/sanction_ui then changing them as needed
